# Blindmaze

Welcome to **Blindmaze**, a thrilling game where light is both a guide and a precious commodity. Navigate through the darkness of randomly generated mazes and seek out the elusive green orbs that hold the power to illuminate your path.

## Game Overview

In **Blindmaze**, you are a point of light in an ever-changing world of darkness. Your goal is to collect all the green orbs in each maze to advance to the next challenge. But beware, each world brings new dangers, from dead walls that reset your progress to roaming enemies that lurk in the shadows.

## Features

- **Randomly Generated Mazes:** Each playthrough offers a unique challenge with mazes generated on the fly.
- **Evolving Gameplay:** As you progress through the worlds, new elements are introduced, increasing the difficulty and requiring strategic thinking.
- **Darkness Mechanic:** Limited visibility around the point of light makes for an intense and immersive experience.
- **Three Unique Worlds:**
  - The first world is a gentle introduction to the mechanics of the game.
  - The second world introduces 'dead' walls that hinder your progress.
  - The third world adds enemies moving randomly, adding a layer of complexity and danger.
